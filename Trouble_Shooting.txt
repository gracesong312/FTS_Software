Things to include in a trouble shooting/useful info menu:

- If there is only noise being output on the DAQ stream it is likely that the wrong channel was provided
- All DAQ measurements are made in differential mode
- If the motor does not connect properly - try a power cycle.  Sometimes previous hang ups of running the
  scripts can cause a problem
- Make sure to restart the kernel each failure.  Although everything is killed appropriately when closing 
  the script, if it crashes at some point it make not make all the correct closing commands.

-The chopper takes an 8-bit number to determine it's speed, breaking 0-1 Hz from [0,255]
